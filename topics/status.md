# Current Status

## Data Structures

1. **Arrays**: Understood but not much problem solved
2. **Linked List**: Understood but no problem solved.

Pending: Stacks, Queues, Trees, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Hash Map, Priority Queue, Dynamic Programming, Graph, Graph Traversal

## Algorithms

1. **Recursion**: Solved a few problem, comfortable.

## Problems:

1. CodeChef: Solving mostly codechef beginners problems.
2. HackerRank: Will start solving hacker rank problem also section wise.
3. HackerEarth: Good for solving topic wise problems.
4. A2Ojladder: Good for solving problems according to difficulty level.
5. https://cses.fi/problemset/
6. Codeforces: Didn't tired yet.

## Target

1. Solve problems on arrays from gfg
2. solve the beginner problems from codechef.
