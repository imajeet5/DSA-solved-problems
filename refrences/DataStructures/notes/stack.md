## Stack

Stack is an abstract data type. Means there will be a specific order in which you can insert, delete or access your elements.

### Operations

1. Insert -> push()

2. Delete -> pop()

3. Access element -> topmost element. top();

4. Size -> size();

5. isEmpty() -> boolean T/F

Recursion uses stack.    


Stack can be implemented using both linked list and arrays
