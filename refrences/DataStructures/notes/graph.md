## Graph Data Structure
 - Graph is a Data Structure which is very common and very useful for representing real world problems
 - In graph we have set of vertices and set of edges connecting those vertices
 - Graph does not have pattern as with tree.
 - Example: Social Network, Roadmap of city
 - Tree data structure is also a special kind of graph.
 
 ### Properties of Trees  vs Graph:
 1. Tree is connected, there always exist one path from one node to another where as graph node can be connected or disconnected.
 2. Tree is always Acyclic, i.e., no cycle whereas graph can be cyclic or acyclic
