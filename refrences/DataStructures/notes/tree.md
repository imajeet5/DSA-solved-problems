## Tree DataStructure

- The data structure that that we can use to store the organization structure is called a tree.
- Tree is very similar to linked list. Like linked list if we know that head we can iterate over the entire list, in tree also if we know the root node then we know the complete tree.
- In tree each node is storing the address of many nodes
- A generic tree mean a node can have many children, there is not constrains on number of children a node can have.
